<!-- Express Router -->
 It helps you organize routes (like /users, /listings, /orders, etc.) 
 into separate files, 
 instead of keeping all routes inside one giant app.js.

 <!-- merge params -->

 “Merge params” literally means combining multiple sets of parameters 
 (data values, usually key–value pairs) into one object or dictionary.


 <!-- web cookies -->
  Web cookies (also called HTTP cookies or browser cookies) are small pieces of data
   that a website stores on your computer (inside your browser).

They help websites remember information about you — like your login,
 preferences, or what’s in your shopping cart — so that you don’t have to re-enter it every time.

 A cookie is usually stored as a key–value pair.

 <!-- cookie parser -->
 Cookie-parser is a tool that helps Express apps read and manage cookies easily
