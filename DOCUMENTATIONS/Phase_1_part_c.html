🔹 What are Express errors?

When something goes wrong in your app (like wrong URL, invalid data, DB problem),
 Express lets you create and handle errors in a clean way instead of crashing.

 class ExpressError extends Error {
  constructor(status, message) {
    super();
    this.status = status;
    this.message = message;
  }
}

app.get("/secret", (req, res, next) => {
  next(new ExpressError(401, "You are not allowed!"));
});
