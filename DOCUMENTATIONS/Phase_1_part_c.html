wrapAsync = Express catching errors for you

Validation for Schema -> how to handle req from db side (if someone uses postman)


🔹what is JOI ?
Joi = a tool to check if user’s input is correct or not (on server side);
it's an NPM library we need to install it
we use a schema for server side validation

-> we do this in Schema.js ,there we set everything required .
we will use listingSchema.validate(req.body) in post route in app.js
// Joi will only detect the error 
then well will throw Express Error


VALIDATE LISTING 
->make a fn in app.js name validate listing ,and put all the validating code in that
then this will be passed as a middleware every where

🔹 What are Express errors?

When something goes wrong in your app (like wrong URL, invalid data, DB problem),
 Express lets you create and handle errors in a clean way instead of crashing.

 class ExpressError extends Error {
  constructor(status, message) {
    super();
    this.status = status;
    this.message = message;
  }
}

app.get("/secret", (req, res, next) => {
  next(new ExpressError(401, "You are not allowed!"));
});
