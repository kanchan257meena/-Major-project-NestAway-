<!-- MVC controller -->

MVC is like the basic rulebook for building clean web apps.
Instead of mixing everything everywhere, it divides your project into three simple parts.

Model
Handles database logic
Example: Listing.find(), User.create()

View
Handles UI display
Example: EJS, HTML files

Controller 
Handles logic & flow
Example: you click "edit", controller fetches listing and sends it to view
