Handling deletion (using Mongoose Middleware)

we can use 2 middleware
-> pre-run before the query is executed (
    executed one after another, when each middleware calls next
)
-> post - run after the query is executed

<a href="../../BACKEND/Database_reln/Models/customer.js">customer</a>

find by id and delete calls find one and delete 
which will call Mongoose middleware;


<!-- NEW MODEL REVIEWS -->
 -comment {string}
 -rating(1 to 5) 
 -createdAt {date ,time}


 create a review schema and add and array in the listing schema

 <!-- creting reviews -->
  1.setting up the Review form

  2.submitting the form 
  here we will create a relationship of the review witht the listing(one to many)
  post/listings/:id/reviews 

  
 <!-- Validation for reviews -->

 empty review should not be submitted both from  server side and client side
 use required for client side validation then bootstrap "needs-validation"

server side validation 1- joi schema , 2- schema validation fn , 3- middleware

<!-- Deleting reviews -->

Mongo $pull operator

The $pull operator in MongoDB is used to remove (pull out) 
all instances of a value or values that match a given condition or value.

delete btn -> listings/:id.review/:reviewId
