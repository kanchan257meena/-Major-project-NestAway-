<!-- Session -->
 the time slot when the user is using or interacting with the web site is called a session.
A Session is like a special folder created by the server
 to store a user’s information while they are using the website.

 <!-- What is “State”? -->

State simply means remembering data or information about a user or system for some time.

🧠 Think of “state” like memory.

When you open a website, do something (like login, add items to cart, etc.),
 the website needs to remember who you are or what you did 
 — that is called maintaining state. protocol - (ftp)

 there are also stateless protocol - do not save data (http)

 <!-- Express Session -->
 Express Session = a way for your website to remember a user
  while they browse different pages.
Normally, websites forget you on every page.
 Express Session helps the server remember you.


<!-- What is express-session (npm package)? -->

express-session is an official middleware that manages sessions in Express.js.

It:
Creates and manages session IDs
Stores session data on the server
Sends session ID to the browser in a cookie
Lets you easily access or update session info in req.session

app.use(session({
  secret: 'mySecretKey',        // used to sign session ID cookie (must be secret)
  resave: false,                // don’t save session if nothing changed
  saveUninitialized: true,      // save new sessions even if empty
  cookie: { maxAge: 60000 }     // cookie expires after 1 minute
}));

The secret works like a password for your sessions —
 it protects the data from being modified by anyone else.


 <!-- connect flash --> it is an npm library
  Connect Flash helps you show one-time messages to the user 
  (like “Login Successful!” or “Error: Invalid Password”) and
   then automatically removes them.
 -> it is cumpulsory to use sessions to use flash
