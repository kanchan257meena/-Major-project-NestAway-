 Authorization - it is the process of verifying what specific appln , files , and data a 
 user has access to

 <!-- Storing password -->
  we store it's hashed form not og

  <!-- Hashing Function -->
For every input, there is a fixed output.
They are one-way functions; we can’t get input from output.
For a different input, there is a different output but of the same length.
Small changes in input should bring large changes in output.

eg-SHA-256 

<!-- Salting  -->
 password salting is a technique to protect passwords stored in databases
 by adding a string of 32 or more characters and then hashing them.
eg- (%?@)

<!-- Passport -->
Passport is a tool in Node.js that helps you add login and authentication 
to your website without writing everything from scratch. 

<!-- What Passport does for you? -->

Checks if username-password is correct
Helps store user login in session (so they stay logged in)
Lets users log in with Google, GitHub, Facebook etc with very little code
Prevents writing login logic again and again

<!-- passport local -->
 Passport Local is just one strategy of Passport.
It means: login using username/email and password.

<!-- configuring Strategy -->
 passport.initialize()
This starts Passport.
Think of it like turning the engine on so Passport can work.

passport.session()
This helps keep a user logged in across pages.
Like remembering the user so they don’t need to log in again on every click.

passport.use(new LocalStrategy(User.authenticate()))
This tells Passport:
Use local login (username+password) and 
check users using our database method User.authenticate().
